This project explored the implementation of the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to address a key communication challenge in distributed systems: how to efficiently locate and retrieve resources in a decentralized and dynamic network. The chosen algorithm, Kademlia, balances simplicity and efficiency, making it an ideal candidate for this purpose. 

The implementation followed the original design outlined in the paper Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazieres, with some adaptations for modern contexts. The keyspace was upgraded to 256 bits (SHA-256) for improved relevance and security, and the RPCs were implemented using gRPC in Go. Docker containers were used to simulate a distributed network environment, allowing for comprehensive testing of RPC functionality and the iterative lookup process.
